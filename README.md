# civicrm-wp-docker

Build a CiviCRM+Wordpress site using a self-contained docker image.

# After deploying

Once you've deployed the container, you need to activate CiviCRM. This has to be done via the interface after a working instance of Wordpress is running.

See the `example` folder for the instructions on how to get started.

# Commentary

The wordpress Docker hub images are a mess, to put it gently. They do strange and bad things.

# Inspiration and Thanks
