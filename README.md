# civicrm-docker

Build a CiviCRM+Wordpress site using a self-contained docker image.

# Commentary

The wordpress Docker hub images are a mess, to put it gently. They do strange and bad things.

# Inspiration and Thanks

Inspired by: https://lab.civicrm.org/lbbef/civicrm-docker. However, this repository appears to be long-abandoned.
